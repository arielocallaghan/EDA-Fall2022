## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}


TPAIC<- lm(data = NTL.chem.raw, temperature_C ~ year4,  + temperature_C ~ daynum + temperature_C ~ depth)



#Choose a model by AIC in a Stepwise Algorithm
step(TPAIC)
Tempmodel <- lm(data = NTL.chem., temptp_ug ~ dissolvedOxygen + temperature_C + tn_ug)
summary(TPmodel)

#10
#from lesson 6
TPregression <- lm(data = subset(PeterPaul.chem.nutrients, lakename == "Paul Lake"), 
                   tp_ug ~ depth + dissolvedOxygen)
summary(TPregression)

TPplot <- ggplot(subset(PeterPaul.chem.nutrients, lakename == "Paul Lake"), 
                 aes(x = dissolvedOxygen, y = tp_ug, color = depth)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlim(0, 20)
print(TPplot)

par(mfrow = c(2,2), mar=c(4,4,4,4))
plot(TPregression)
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
