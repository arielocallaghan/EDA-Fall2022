## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)

  mutate(Date=my(paste0(Month,"-",Year)),
         PWSID= !!pwsid,
         ownership= !!ownership)

#Modify the dataframe to include the facility name and type as well as the date (as date object)
df_withdrawals <- df_withdrawals %>% 
  mutate(Registrant = !!the_registrant,
         Facility_name = !!the_facility_name,
         Facility_type = !!the_facility_type,
         Date = my(paste(Month,"-",Year)))

#r4
#remove before submitting testing other methods 
#df_withdrawls<-data.frame(
#  "Water System" = water.system.name,
#  "PSWID" = pswid,
#  "Ownership" = ownership,
#  "Max Daily Use"= as.numeric(max.withdrawals.mgd)) %>%
  mutate(Month=Month,
         Year= rep(2021,12),
         Date=my(paste0(Month,"-",Year)),
         PWSID= !!pwsid,
         ownership= !!ownership)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
